X220 Tablet Utility Script
==========================

Synopsis
--------

`tabletop` is a simple script to control some basic **Tablet Op**tions, and
help with common tablet PC tasks, like rotating the internal display and
keeping the tablet input devices synchronized with the change.

Features
--------

* Rotate or invert the internal display, and synchronize the tablet input
  devices with the rotation. (*Note:* this happens independently of any
  external displays, in contrast with the annoying Windows tablet software...)
* Enable / disable the finger touch (for when you're writing)
* Enable / disable power saving features for the tablet
* Map tablet events to the internal display (useful when an external monitor
  is attached which has a different resolution than the internal)
* Takes care of some unexpected nuisances, like the fact that the Lenovo
  trackpoint is sensitive enough to respond to the pressure of you writing on
  the tablet surface.


Configuration / Setup
---------------------

I find it convenient to map the tablet function keys to invocations of the
script.  To put the computer into tablet mode (for when I'm writing notes), I
invert the screen and disable the touch:

	tabletop -iT

And to put it back into normal mode, I set the screen to its normal
orientation, and turn the touch back on.

	tabletop -It

If you use the touch more than you write with the stylus, or if you have no
issues with leaving the touch on while writing, then remove the `t` and `T`
options above.


Supported Hardware
------------------

It has only been tested on the X220T, but it is conjectured that it would work
on most other tablet PC's as well (with or without trackpoint).
