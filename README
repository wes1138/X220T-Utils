X220 Tablet Utility Script
==========================

Synopsis
--------

A simple script to automate some of the basic tablet PC necessities.

Features
--------

* Rotate or invert the internal display, and synchronize the tablet input
  devices with the rotation. (*Note:* this happens independently of any
  external displays, in contrast with the annoying Windows tablet software...)
* Enable / disable the finger touch (for when you're writing)
* Enable / disable power saving features for the tablet
* Map tablet events to the internal display (useful when an external monitor
  is attached which has a different resolution than the internal)
* Takes care of some unexpected nuisances, like the fact that the Lenovo
  trackpoint is sensitive enough to respond to the pressure of you writing on
  the tablet surface.

Supported Hardware
------------------

It works for the X220T, but it might be useful for other tablet PC's as well.
